Random Forest is a machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their outputs to make predictions.
Random Forest is a well-known ensemble learning system that combines numerous decision trees to increase prediction accuracy while minimizing overfitting.

A random forest is formed by training a large number of decision trees independently on different subsets of the training data, with each tree generating its own prediction. During the training process, the algorithm chooses a subset of features at random for each tree, which helps to boost tree diversity.


Each tree in the forest produces its own prediction when a new data point is fed into the model for prediction. The random forest's ultimate prediction is then chosen by collecting the majority vote of all individual tree projections.

Random forests have several advantages, including the capacity to handle both classification and regression tasks, high-dimensional data, and identifying the most significant features for making predictions. They are, however, computationally expensive and may not perform well on tiny datasets.
