Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in any data analysis project, including those involving logistic regression. EDA involves visually and statistically examining the data to identify patterns, relationships, and anomalies that may be relevant to the analysis.
Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In other words, it is a way to predict a continuous outcome variable based on one or more predictor variables. The term "linear" refers to the fact that the relationship between the variables can be described by a straight line.

In a simple linear regression, there is only one independent variable, while in multiple linear regression, there are two or more independent variables. The goal of linear regression is to find the line that best fits the data and can be used to make predictions about the dependent variable.

The equation for a simple linear regression model can be written as:

Y = β0 + β1X + ε

Where Y is the dependent variable, X is the independent variable, β0 is the intercept, β1 is the slope, and ε is the error term.

The goal of linear regression is to estimate the values of β0 and β1 that minimize the sum of squared errors (SSE) between the predicted values of Y and the actual values of Y.

Linear regression has many applications in various fields, such as finance, economics, engineering, social sciences, and more. It is a powerful tool for predicting outcomes and understanding the relationship between variables.
