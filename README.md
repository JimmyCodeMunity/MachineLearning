Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable computer systems to automatically learn and improve their performance on a specific task or problem.

The key idea behind machine learning is to enable the computer system to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. This means that the computer system can use past experiences or data to make predictions or decisions about new data that it has not seen before.

There are three main types of machine learning:

Supervised learning: In this type of learning, the computer system is trained on a labeled dataset, which means that each data point is accompanied by a label or target variable. The system learns to map input data to output labels based on patterns and relationships in the data.

Unsupervised learning: In this type of learning, the computer system is trained on an unlabeled dataset, which means that there are no target variables or labels. The system learns to find patterns and relationships in the data on its own, without any guidance.

Reinforcement learning: In this type of learning, the computer system learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or punishments. The system learns to make decisions that maximize the reward and minimize the punishment.

Machine learning has many practical applications in various industries, such as healthcare, finance, retail, and manufacturing, to name a few. Some examples of machine learning applications include image recognition, natural language processing, fraud detection, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.
